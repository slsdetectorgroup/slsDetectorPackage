2 New, Changed or Resolved Features
=====================================



2.1 Breaking API
==================


    Firmware
    --------

    *   [Jungfrau] Status register and Sync mode fix
        The regiser bit definition changed and fixes for stable control in sync mode.
        Effect: Master and slaves give same status (previously master is sometimes 'idle' when acquisition is stopped), same #frames left and #nextframenumber.
        Also ERROR status connected, but never noticed to occur.

        For user, everything is transparent unless one touches status register
        using advanced commands. 


    *   [Moench] Status: Development mode
        Moench is now being made compatible with Jungfrau v2.0 readout boards. 
        Hence, firmware and software is in development mode. 
        7.x.x will continue to have fixes for Moench until this version is deployed.


    *   [Ctb] Fixes and features described later on.


    Client
    ======


    *   Datatype change of port numbers from int to uint16_t   
        API: setVirtualDetectorServers, 
        get/setRxPort, get/setControlPort, get/setStopPort,
        get/setDestinationUDPPort(2), get/setRxZmqPort, get/setClientZmqPort


    *   [Eiger] versions, hardware version, febl/r firmware version 
        Versions command modified to give more info about hardware version ['fx30', 'fx70'] and Febl/r firmware versions.
        Command line: versions (output modified), hardwareversion (added for Eiger)
        API added for Eiger: getHardwareVersion, getFrontEndFirmwareVersion
        Enums added: fpgaPosition {FRONT_LEFT, FRONT_RIGHT}
    

    *   [Ctb] Voltage->Power name change
        Command line: voltagelist ->powerlist
        API: get/setVoltage -> get/setPower, get/setVoltageList -> get/setPowerList,
        getMeasuredVoltage -> getMeasuredPower



2.2 Resolved or Changed Features
================================


    Detector Server
    ---------------


    *   Set bit and clear bit validation
        Previously, validation expected all the other bits in the register to 
        not change. Now, it only validates the selected bit.

    
    *   [Jungfrau] Electron collection mode (bit 14 of 0x5D register)
        Affected Command line: setbit, clearbit, reg
        Affected API: setBit, clearBit, writeRegister
        Electron collection mode and requires chip reconfiguration. 
        Temporary fix added that touching this bit will reconfigure chip if chip 
        is v1.1 and powered on. Permanent fix by introducing a command for the 
        same in future release.
    

    *   [Ctb] Fixes

        -   Patioctrl, patsetbit, patbitmask
            MSB (64 bit unsigned) could not be set as a value of -1 was interpreted 
            as a 'get'. Fixed in server. 

        -   Allow dac tristate when v_limit is set. Fixed.

        -   Changing fw bit from disable analog to enable analog

        -   Allow adc enable for 1 GbE and 10GbE to be 0.

        -   Slow ADCs previously misread (a high 5k+ value). Firmware updated 
            and software adjusted now.

        -   Allow non blocking acquire for 1GbE. Added Transmitting status when it
            might still be reading from fifo.

        -   Clean memory before reading from fifo in 1GbE mode. Read fifo then
            RD strobe (corresponding firmware fix) fixes number of reads, but 
            increases all pipelines by 1.
        
        -   Fixed pattern viewer (auto legend buf without wait and loop), allow 
            pyat files. (/patterngenerator)


    Simulator
    ---------

    *   Unique TCP port for multiple simulators
        Checks include unique TCP port-hostname combo.


    Receiver
    --------


    *   Unique TCP port for multiple receivers
        7.x.x already has automatically increasing TCP ports in shared memory 
        for multiple receivers. Now, checks include unique TCP port-hostname 
        combo.


    *   [Ctb] Fixes

        -   Readout mode updated
            'rx_hostname' should configure the receiver with parameters from detector,
            but readout mode in receiver always configured at start up to Analog only. 
            Fixed.

        -   Incorrect image size in zmq header, which happens when dbit list is 
            less than 64 bits. Fixed.

        -   Rearranging digital data when dbit list less than 64 bits fixed.


    Client
    ------

    *   [Jungfrau][Mythen3][Gotthard2] Sync mode should have at least one master
        Multi module synced detectors should have at least one master when 
        starting acquisition, else it will throw. Once master is done acquiring, 
        status of all modules checked to ensure none of the slaves in waiting default
        to hardware issues such as cabling.



2.3 New Features
================


    Client
    ------
    

    *   [Jungfrau] Pedestal mode
        Command line: pedestalmode
        API: get/setPedestalMode
        Example: 
            pedestalmode 0 # turns off pedestal mode
            pedestalmode 50 10 # turns on pedestal mode (50 pedestal frames, 10 loops)
        
        In pedestal mode, number of frames/triggers
        is overwritten by '#pedestal_frames x #pedestal_loops x 2'.
        In auto timing mode or trigger mode with #frames > 1, #frames is overwritten
        with #triggers is 1. Otherwise, #triggers is overwritten with #frames is 1.
        In pedestal mode, one cannot set #frames, #triggers or timing mode (exception).

        Disabling pedestal mode will set back to normal mode with normal previous
        values of #frames and #triggers.


    *   Source UDP IP: Auto
        Command line: udp_srcip, udp_srcip2
        API: get/setSourceUDPIP(2)
        Allow 'auto' for udp_srcip to pick up IP from detector hostname. Not allowed
        for Gotthard1.


    *   Custom row and column for detector UDP header
        Command line: row, column
        API: get/setRow, get/setColumn
        By default, row and column of module is determined in a pre-determined 
        manner or by custom detector size (Command line: detsize).
        This is useful if user accesses row and column in multi- detector UDP header 
        or for the GUI to rearrange for complete image.
        Option now added to set custom row and column. 


    *   [Ctb] Features

        -   List for ADC, signal, power, slowadc 
            Also allow their list to set names and to obtain their indices and values.

            Command line: dacname, dacindex, 
            adclist, adcname, adcindex, 
            signallist, signalname,signalindex, 
            powerlist, powername, powerindex, powervalues,
            slowadclist, slowadcname, slowadcindex, slowadcvalues

            API: get/setDacName, getDacIndex, 
            get/setAdcNames, getAdcIndex, get/setAdcName,
            get/setSignalNames, getSignalIndex, get/setSignalName,
            get/setPowerNames, getPowerIndex, get/setPowerName, getPowerList,
            get/setSlowADCNames, getSlowADCIndex, get/setSlowADCName, getSlowADCList

        -   Added more modes for transceiver in read out mode.
            Allow to set number of samples and enable mask for transceiver.

            Command line: romode (more modes: 'transceiver', 'digital_transceiver'),
            tsamples, transceiverenable
            API: get/setTransceiverEnableMask, get/setNumberOfTransceiverSamples,
            get/setReadoutMode (more enums: TRANSCEIVER_ONLY, DIGITAL_AND_TRANSCEIVER)


        -   Command to get file name with path of last pattern uploaded.
            Command line: patfname
            API: getPatterFileName


    *   Automatic test script for all virtual simulators added.
