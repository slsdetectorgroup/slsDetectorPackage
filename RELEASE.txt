2. New Features
===============

    Client
    ------
    1.  Compilation requirements
        They are very different now and can be accessed at
            https://slsdetectorgroup.github.io/devdoc/dependencies.html
        Gui not included in default cmk.sh script. Must be explicitly asked for.

    2.  Manuals 
        They can be compiled in the package. 
            https://slsdetectorgroup.github.io/devdoc/installation.html#build-this-documentation
        Or refer to the documentation provided in 
            https://slsdetectorgroup.github.io/devdoc/index.html

    3.  API
        Changed to Detector class. 
        C++: Detector.h
            Documentation:
                https://slsdetectorgroup.github.io/devdoc/detector.html
            Examples to use the Detector class:
                https://github.com/slsdetectorgroup/api-examples

        Python API Documentation: 
            https://slsdetectorgroup.github.io/devdoc/pydetector.html

        Command line:
            Many commands have become deprecated. They will still execute, 
            but give a warning.
            Documentation:
                https://slsdetectorgroup.github.io/devdoc/commandline.html
            Help on a command:
                sls_detector_help [command], or
                sls_detector_get -h [command]
    
    4.  Exceptions
        They are thrown instead of providing error codes.
            sls_detector_exceptions.h
        Make sure you catch all exceptions in custom gui and handle them or 
        inform the user.

    5.  Scans
        One can do scans for dacs or trimbits. Trimbits are only for Eiger or 
        Mythen3. Set it scan mode and then acquire using blocking or non blocking
        method.

    6.  Timing Commands (eg. period)
        In command line, all timing commands can now specify unit. 
            eg 100ms 10us, 1s, 100ns
        In C++ API, one must use chrono library.
        In Python API, xxx

    7.  Enum list (daclist)
        Command line and API now has features to get the list of enums/commands
        for dacs, settings, dynamic range, timing modes and temperatures for 
        the detector in shared memory. 
            eg. daclist, settingslist, drlist, timinglist, templist
        Command line also has commands to get their values.
            eg. dacvalues, tempvalues,
        
    8.  Command Line (Dac)
        All dac commands have been converted to a single "dac" command with 
        the previous dac commands as arguments.
            eg. sls_detector_get vcmp_ll
            is now
            sls_detector_get dac vcmp_ll
    
    9.  UDP Configuration
        Once all the udp details are set in the detector, the detector's
        destination is then configured automatically. If the detector is not 
        configured, it will  fail when acquiring. If any of these parameters
        are also changed, then this is configured again. Hence, configuremac 
        command has been removed. Instead, there are commands such as
        udp_validate (to validate if it has been configured) and
        udp_reconfigure (to reconfigure).

    10. Gap Pixels
        Gap pixels are now only available in client call back or gui (not in 
        receiver anymore). It can be enabled for Eiger and Jungfrau and 
        includes inter chip and inter module gap pixels.

    Detector Servers
    ----------------

    1.  Detector Simulators 
        Or virtual detector servers for every detector have been provided. 
        They are compiled along with the client by enabling its option. 
        They should also send fake data (increasing pixel/channel value).  

    2.  (Jungfrau) settings
        Settings command do not implicitly set default dacs from now on.
        One can use the command 'defaultdacs' to set them explicitly.

    3.  Shared Memory
        Almost all the detector parameters removed from shared memory.
        Therefore, they are all fetched directly from detector.

    4.  (Eiger) config_eiger.txt
        A config file on the detector can take in 2 parameters "master" 
        and "top" being set to 1 or 0 to enable or disable the same.
        When server is started without this file, it is set to hardware
        settings.
        The detector is also deactivated by default and activated only 
        upon setting hostname in the client. This is to ensure ????????

    5.  (Eiger) Partial readout - readnlines
        It is possible for partial readouts, where you specify the number
        of pixel rows to read out. Not all values are allowed. The current
        slsReceiver does not complain about missing packets, but only puts 
        this partial image into the complete image (padding the rest). One
        can cut out required subimage using callbacks, but this feature
        is probably more useful for custom receivers.

    6.  (Eiger, Jungfrau) Starting Frame number - startframenumber
        Both now have running frame numbers that is only reset at boot up
        and increments continuously through acquisitions. One is able to 
        set the starting frame number before an acquisition.

    7.  (Jungfrau) Two 10G data interfaces
        Only Jungfrau PCBs with version 2.0 can run at full speed using both
        the 10G UDP interfaces to stream out data. This is available from 
        the current firmware and software. To enable two interfaces, one has 
        to enable two interfaces using "numinterfaces" to 2 and set corresponding
        udp_dstip2, udp_dstport2 etc. One can also decide to select which of 
        the two interfaces to use, when using only 1 interface.

    8.  (Eiger) Removed Features
        storeinram, safe speed and ability to set settings via the settings 
        command has been removed.

    Receiver
    --------

    1.  Zmq
        The static library and the zmq.h is no longer provided with package.
        One must install ZeroMQ version 4.
        ZmqSocket.h API has changed, especially in parsing receiving JSON header.
        One must pick up needed parameters  from exposed struct zmqHeader in 
        ZmqSocket.h.

    2.  Metadata
        Additional detector dependant metadata has been added to the master files.

    3.  Shared Memory
        Almost all receiver parameters have been removed from client shared memory.
        Therefore the receiver process needs to be alive to access any receiver
        parameter as they are now fetched directly from the receiver.

    4.  UDP IP
        Since all the parameters are fetched from receiver or detector directly 
        (not shared memory), the udp desintation ip (previously rx_udpip) is safer 
        to be specified before setting rx_hostname. Setting it before has the
        advantage that the detector is updated first before the receiver is
        requested for the udp mac. This helps when changing pc and the receiver
        cannot find the udp ip to get the udp mac.


    Gui
    ---
    
    1.  Zmq high water mark
        When opening the Gui, the zmq send and receiver high water mark is set to 2
        instead of default (1000 for zmq library version 4). This is to ensure
        fast and large detectors can still see latest data on the gui at the cost of
        losing images in between.
        When using a different processor or client data call back to handle zmq data, 
        please ensure this is set back to default to get every zmq packet. Setting it to 
        -1 sets it to library defaults.

3. Resolved Issues
==================

    Detector Server
    ---------------

    1.  (Eiger) blocked server
        Very rarely, Eiger control or stop server would block and would require a restart
        of server. This is due to both servers accessing the same link to get to FEB
        registers. Locking has been implemented in server shared memory to resolve.
