1. Topics Concerning
====================

    - Jungfrau server (new firmware mapped)
    - Eiger server (measuredPeriod, reg)
    - Gotthard server(ADC channel shift, ROI, 25um slave packets)
    - Receiver (padding, releasing resources segfault, gappixels)
    - Users class (detectorSize, ROI, versions, status)
    - API (config error, ROI)
    - Compile (static libraries, Makefile for API)
    - Gui (multi module)



2. Resolved Issues
==================          

    Detector Server
    ---------------
    
    1.  (Jungfrau): Latest Jungfrau firmware release mapped.
    
    2.  (Eiger): Measured subperiod initially wrapped around 4.29s. Now, upto 42.9s.
        
        Advanced command "reg" was writing only to right FPGA. 
    
    3.  (Gotthard 25/50um): Since Gotthard only sends packet numbers, one had to 
        remember to take even number of images in ROI mode, if they wanted to 
        switch back to non ROI mode.
        This is fixed now, but temporary fix involves sending an image during 
        configuration, which will not be captured by the receiver. Hence, it takes
        longer to configure. Permanent fix will require a firmware update.
           
        The detector output is shifted by 1 for every 32 channels. This is fixed now.
        
        
    Receiver
    --------
    
    1.  Receiver padding was enabled only if deactivated padding was also enabled.
        Receiver padding enable and receiver deactivated padding enable are independent now.
        
    2.  Starting and stopping receiver without listening resulted in seg faults.
    
    3.  Gappixels in receiver bug fix.
        
        
    Client
    ------
            
    1.  (Users class): DetectorSize modified to set/get ROI if ROI is only 1 in number.
    
        Allowed setting/getting ROI at single detector level via API. 
        (ROI for Gotthard only). Added them to the users class as setROI and getROI.
        
        Retrieving versions at module level is possible now.
        
        Added "stopped" as status in getRunStatus list.
    
    2.  (API): Incorrect mac address in config file will set error flag in API and not just
        print the error.
        
        ROI possible at module level.
         
    
    Compile
    -------
    
    1.  Static libraries removed.
    
    2.  slsDetectorPackage/manual/manual-api/Makefile modified to use libraries
        from slsDetectorPackage/bin as the main Makefile copies the libraries there. 
        No effect when using CMakeFiles.
    

    Gui
    ---
        
    1.  Adding multiple detectors in x and y direction incremented number of detectors
        in y direction incorrectly. Effect seen only in GUI (segfault) if 
        detsizechan has multi detectors in both direction. Fixed.
        
        
        
3. Known Issues
===============
    
    Detector Specific 
    -----------------
    
    1.  (Gotthard 25 um): Slave misses or captures an extra frame. Occurs irregularly.
    
    2.  (Gotthard 25/50um): Using ROI (2 chips, 256 channels) missses last pixel
        of that ADC.
