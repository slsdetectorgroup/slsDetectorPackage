1. New or Changed Features
==========================

- Fixed minor warnings (will fix commandline print of excess packets for missing packets)
- ctb slow adcs and any other adcs (other than temp) goes to the control Server
- number of udp interfaces is 2 for Eiger (CHANGE IN API??)
- added module id for virtual servers into the udp header
- refactoring (rxr)
- fixed patsetbit and patsetmask for moench
- changed default vref of adc9257 to 2V for moench (from 1.33V)
- moench and ctb - can set the starting frame number of next acquisition
- mythen server kernel check incompatible (cet timezone)
- rx_arping
- rx_threadsids max is now 9 (breaking api)
- fixed datastream disabling for eiger. Its only available in 10g mode.
- m3 server crash (vthrehsold dac names were not provided)
- allow vtrim to be interpolated for Eiger settings
- m3 setThresholdEnergy and setAllThresholdEnergy was overwriting gaincaps with settings enum
- can set localhost with virtual server with minimum configuration: (hostname localhost, rx_hostname localhost, udp_dstip auto)
- increases the progress according to listened index. (not processed index)
- current frame index points to listened frame index (not processed index)
- when in discard partial frames or empty mode, the frame number doesnt increase by 1, it increases to that number (so its faster)
- file write disabled by default
- eiger 12 bit mode
- start non blocking acquisition at modular level
- connect master commands to api (allow set master for eiger)
--ignore-config command line
- command line argument 'master' mainly for virtual servers (also master/top for real eiger), only one virtual server for eiger, use command lines for master/top
- stop servers also check for errors at startup( in case it was running with an older version)
- hostname cmd failed when connecting to servers in update mode (ctb, moench, jungfrau, eiger)
- missingpackets signed (negative => extra packets)
- framescaught and frameindex now returns a vector for each port
- progress looks at activated or enabled ports, so progress does not stagnate
- (eiger) disable datastreaming also for virtual servers only for 10g
- missing packets also takes care of disabled ports
- added geometry to metadata
- 10g eiger nextframenumber get fixed.
- stop, able to set nextframenumber to a consistent (max + 1) for all modules if different (eiger/ctb/jungfrau/moench)
- ctb: can set names for all the dacs
- fpga/kernel programming, checks if drive is a special file and not a normal file
- gotthard 25 um image reconstructed in gui and virtual hdf5 (firmware updated for slave to reverse channels)
- master binary file in json format now
- fixed bug introduced in 6.0.0: hdf5 files created 1 file per frame after the initial file which had maxframesperfile
- rx_roi
- m3 polarity, interpolation (enables all counters when enabled), pump probe, analog pulsing, digital pulsing
- updatedetectorserver - removes old server current binary pointing to for blackfin
- removing copydetectorserver using tftp 
- registerCallBackRawDataReady and registerCallBackRawDataModifyReady now gives a sls_receiver_header* instead of a char*, and uint32_t to size_t
- registerCallBackStartAcquisition gave incorrect imagesize (+120 bytes). corrected.
- registerCallBackStartAcquisition parameter is a const string reference
- m3 (runnig config second time with tengiga 0, dr !=32, counters !=0x7) calculated incorrect image size expected
- fixed row column indexing (mainly for multi module Jungfrau 2 interfaces )
- eiger gui row indices not flipped anymore (fix in config)
- m3 (settings dac check disabled temporarily?)
- m3 virtual server sends the right pacets now
- gap pixels in gui enabled by default
- rxr src files and classes (detectordata, ZmqSocket, helpDacs) added to sls namespace, and macros (namely from logger (logINFO etc)), slsDetectorGui (make_unique in implemtnation requires sls nemspace (points to std otherwise) but not deectorImpl.cpp)
- blackfin programing made seamless (nCE fixed which helps)
-save settings file for m3 and eiger
- m3 threshold changes
- g2 and m3 clkdiv 2 (system clock) change should affect time settings (g2: exptime, period, delayaftertrigger, burstperiod, m3: exptime, gatedelay, gateperiod, period, delayaftertrigger)
- g2 system frequency is the same irrespective of timing source
- (apparently) rxr doesnt get stuck anymore from 6.1.1
- rxr mem size changed (fifo header size from 8 to 16) due to sls rxr header = 112.. 112+ 16=128 (reduces packet losss especially for g2)
-udp_srcip and udp_Srcip2: can set to auto (for virtual or 1g data networks)
- set dataset name for all hdf5 files to "data" only
- number of storage cells is not updated in teh receiver. done. and also allowing it to be modified in running status
- refactored memory structure in receiver and listener code (maybe resolves stuck issue, need to check)
- callback modified to have rx header and not rx header pointer
- adapted for g2 hdi v2.0. able to set master from server command line, server config file, and client.
- rx udp socket refactored (maybe resolves getting stuck?)remove check for eiger header and isntead checks for malformed packets for every detector
- jungfrau sw trigger , blocking trigger
-help should not create a new object
- jungfrau master
- g2 parallel command
- jungfrau sync
- m3 bad channels (badchannel file also for g2 extended to include commas and colons, remove duplicates)
- m3 fix for gain caps to invert where needed when loading from trimbit file (fix for feature might have been added only in developer branch)
- pat loop and wait address default
- ctb and moench Fw fixed (to work with pattern commdand) )addreess length
- setting rx_hostname (or udp_dstip with rx_hostname not none) will always set udp_dstmac. solves problem of chaing udp_dstip and udp_dstmac stays the same
- jungfrau reset core and usleep removed (fix for 6.1.1 is now fixed in firmware)
- g2 change clkdivs 2 3 4 to defaults for burst and cw mode.
- ctb and moench: allowing 1g non blocking acquire to send data
- gain plot zooming fixed (disabled, acc. to main plot)
- ctb, moench, jungfrau (pll reset at start fixed, before no defines)
