1 Resolved Issues
=================


    Firmware
    --------

    *   [Eiger] Blocking trigger on quad
        Previously, blocking software trigger on a quad was not blocking. Fixed
        with firmware v32.



    Client
    ------

    *   Limit port number max of 65535
        Previously, one could set the port numbers (TCP, UDP, ZMQ) to values 
        higher than 65535 and also to 0. However, it was truncated to 16 bit
        in the background, but not relayed to the user. 
        Now, it will throw if it is 0 or greater than 65535 (16 bit).

    *   Stopping acqusition for a single or subset of modules
        The Detector API previously stopped all modules.
        Now, it takes into account which modules the user wanted to stop.

    *   [Jungfrau] Stop in sync mode
        When stopping acquisition in sync mode, only the master module sometimes 
        returns 'Idle' state instead of 'Stopped'. The software threw an 
        exception for the different states then.
        Now, it does not throw and a fix will be added to the next firmware 
        release for the different states (with SW release: v8.0.0).

    *   [Eiger] Error in Stop
        When stopping acquisition, if a half module were to give an error in a 
        rare case while the others succeeded, this would result in an re-attempt 
        to stop 9 more times before throwing an incorrect exception that it 
        could not stop.
        Now, it is handled and will throw an exception of the error status
        immediately.



    Receiver
    --------

    *   Limit TCP port number (command line) to max of 65535
        Refer issue under 'Client'.


    
    Detector Simulator
    ------------------

    *   Limit TCP port number (command line) to max of 65535
        Refer issue under 'Client'.


    Gui
    ---

    *   [Jungfrau] Color map of gain plot
        Previously, color on the gain plot did not update after the first image, 
        unless there were x/y min/max changes or window resizing. Fixed.



    Data Processing
    ---------------

    *   [Moench] Segmentation fault with moench03RawDataPrcess
        Previously, it crashed when nframes > 0. Fixed.

    *   [Moench] Moench interpolation issues fixed.
