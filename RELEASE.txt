SLS Detector Package 3.1.4 released on 2018-08-03
=================================================



INTRODUCTION

This document describes the differences between 3.1.4 into 3.1.3 releases.


Topics Concerning
==================
	- get settings in users class
	- HDF5 in Receiver
	- gotthard timer accuracy


Resolved Issues
===============

	Client
	------
	1.	Users class setSettings(-1) gave undefined settings. Has been fixed.
	
	2. 	Users class timers give more precise values now.
	
	3.	When deleting slsDetector object, Stop socket deletion includes a close on 
		default file descriptor zero (which it didn't open, just set for flag).
		This is fixed with temporary solution, to connect stop socket at checkOnline
		to set file descriptor to the right one. Later releases will use exception
		to handle constructor error flags.

	
	Detector Server
	---------------
	1.	(Gotthard) Timers converted from time in nanoseconds to number of cycles
		is made more precise now. Clock value changed from 32.1E+6 to 32.007729E+6. 
	
	
	Receiver
	--------	
	1.	Jungfrau Single Module Master files did not link to the HDF5 data file properly.
		This is fixed now.
		
	2.	Relative linking is used in the HDF5, instead of absolute now.
	


New Features
============

	Client
	------
	1.	Timers can be set/retrieved individually. It has been introduced because
		Gotthard 25um can have different delays for master and slave modules.

	Receiver
	--------
	1.	HDF5 x dimension (#images). Max made unlimited. Chunked Dataset by default.
		
		When receiver gets an image more than #frames, the HDF5 dataset will 
		extend itself in the x dimension by another #frames. So, one can do
		(in Jungfrau, Gotthard, NOT Eiger)
		sls_detector_put resetframescaught 0
		sls_detector_put receiver start
		sls_detector_put status start
		sls_detector_put status start
		...
		sls_detector_put receiver stop
