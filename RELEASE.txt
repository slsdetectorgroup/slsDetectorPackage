1 New, Changed or Resolved Features
=====================================



1.1 New or Changed Features
============================


    Receiver
    --------


    *   Frame Synchronizer
        Added a new binary, similar to slsMultiReceiver, to thread receiver 
        processes, use callbacks for data synchronization and stream out ZMQ
        multipart messages (for each UDP port) together for each acquisition index
        without reconstructing the image. Included start and end ZMQ messages 
        as well for the start and end callback parameters.


    Documentation
    -------------


    *   Command line - multi module and multi detector indices
        Help on this topic has been added to the 'Command line' topic.


    *   Row and column index (UDP header or callback)
        Help on how this is determined from the hostname is added to the 'UDP
        Header' and the 'Quick Start Guide' topics. Also added to the help in '
        hostname' command line help. Please note that this can be overwritten by
        corresponding row and column commands.



1.2 Resolved Features 
======================


    Firmware
    ---------


    *   [Jungfrau] Column select and filter resistor
        Configuration fix for chip v1.1 for these parameters


    Firmware &/ On-board Detector Server
    ------------------------------------


    *   [Jungfrau] Timing Info Decoder 
        Only allowed for hardware v2.0 now.


    *   [Jungfrau] Auto Comparator Disable - chip v1.0
        Previously, this mode for chip v1.0 automatically disabled the on-chip
        gain switching compatator after a fixed portion of the exposure time.
        Now, one must set also the comparator disable time using 'compdisabletime'
        just as in chip v1.1.


    *   [Mythen3] Default period on server start up is 0 now.
        

    Client
    -------


    *   Command line - Multi detector index inside file
        Multi detector index '[index]-' was ignored silently in the config/parameter
        file since 5.0.0. Now, it will throw an exception. Please use the multi
        detector index on the 'config' or 'parameter' command instead.


    *   [Mythen3] patternX command autocompletes the argument to a path now.


    Receiver
    --------


    *   Multiple Receiver objects in multiple threads
        slsMultiReceiver uses child processes, but if user rewrote to use multiple
        receiver objects in multiple threads instead, a callback mutex is now
        implemented to handle the locking mechanism between threads for the callbacks. 


    *   Removed potentially unsafe str().c_str() calls.

 
    ZMQ
    ---


    *   [Moench] Reduced significant print out in zmq processing using energy
        threshold.


    *   [Moench] Zmq dummy packet restreaming command did nothing
        Temporary solution was to move from 'stop' to 'rx_stop' as 'stop' did not
        go further if module is idle.


    *   [Moench] Too many Zmq dummy packets- unclear end in acquire
        Give time to process dummy packet before restreaming it and wait more 
        before restreaming to reduce amoutn of zmq dummy packets to process.


    Simulators
    -----------


    *   [Jungfrau][Moench] Slightly faster transmistting time by removing sleeping
        only if there is a transmission delay
