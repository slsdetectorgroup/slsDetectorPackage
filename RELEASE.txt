2 Compilation Changes
=====================


    *   Pyctbgui
        Ctb GUI in Python is now moved into the package. 
        The only compilation it needs is a minor c extension in place


2 New, Changed or Resolved Features
=====================================



2.1 Breaking API
==================


    Receiver
    --------


    *   Receiver callbacks
        Brought much more metadata to receiver callbacks to construct the image.
        Update MultiReceiverApp to reflect this change.


    *   File path
        At start of acquisition or at rx_start command, the file path is only 
        then verified if it exists and created if it does not.


    Client
    ------


    *   Removed receiver/publisher ZMQ IP
        Command line: rx_zmqip gives a warning and does nothing
        Python : rx_zmqip removed
        C++ API: get/setRxZmqIP removed

        Publisher zmq IP set to '0.0.0.0' or to listen on all interfaces.
        The publisher will determine which interface to stream out from based on
        the network route to the subscriber IP. Hence, receiver zmq IP is not 
        required.


    *   Write register, Set or Clear bit
        Validation for this advanced feature has been removed by default. 
        One can force validation by using --validate in the command line or by 
        setting the validate option in the API.
       

    ZMQ
    ---


    *   Publisher socket constructor does not take an IP anymore.
        The details are above under 'Removed receiver/publisher ZMQ IP'.


    Detector Server
    ---------------


    *   [Mythen3] Only run clock can be set
        Clock 0 is now the run clock and the only one that can be set. 
        The others are be read only.
        This affects the following commands:
        Command line or python API: clkdiv, clkfreq, clkphase, maxclkphaseshift
        C++ API: get/setClockDivider, getClockFrequency, get/setClockPhase, 
        getMaxClockPhaseShift



2.2 Resolved or Changed Features
================================


    Client
    ======


    *   Command line Code Generation
        The command line parsing code is now generated from a yaml file. This is
        transparent to the user.


    Detector Server
    ---------------


    *   [Gotthard2] Chip reconfiguration

            -   Powering off/on the chip will now switch off chip configuration 
                property/ configure the chip every time.

            -   Switching off high voltage from a non zero value will now wait 
                10s to return for safety reasons.

            -   Powering off the chip requires high voltage to have been 
                switched off prior.

            -   Acquisition requires chip to have been configured prior.


    *   [Gotthard2] Burst mode options restricted
        Burst mode external and continuous mode internal are not allowed to be set
        anymore as they are anyway not implemented.


    Simulator
    ---------


    *   Refactored stop server to have better start up

   
    ZMQ
    ---


    *   Publiser socket constructor

        -   enables keep alive socket options to send heartbeat messages to prevent
            discarded TCP flows if there is no packet for a longer period.

        -   enables IPv6 interfaces

    *   Prints specific error for ENOENT (endpoint does not exist)



2.3 New Features
================


    Client
    ------


    *   Auto completion
        bash_autocomplete.sh or zsh_autocomplete.sh must be sourced from the 
        main package folder to enable auto completion of commands and arguments 
        for the command line on that shell.


    *   sls_detector
        New executable that can be used instead of 'sls_detector_get' and 
        'sls_detector_put' for most commands. It will infer from the number of 
        arguments, which executable (sls_detector_put or sls_detector_get) to use. 
        For the rare commands that cannot be inferred from the number of arguments,
        it will complain accordingly.  


    *   [Jungfrau] Timing Info Decoder (Advanced configuration)
        Command line or python API: timing_info_decoder
        C++ API: get/setTimingInfoDecoder. Options: SWISSFEL (Default), SHINE


    *   [Jungfrau] Collection Mode (Advanced configuration)
        Command line or python API: collectionmode 
        C++ API: get/setCollectionMode. Options: ELECTRON, HOLE (Default)
        Also configures the chip afterwards. 
        ///////TODO: Only for chip v1.1?
        
        
    *   [Gotthard2] Next frame number
        'Stop' in G2 25um is not synchronous and hence might trigger an extra set
        of frames in the slave module, resulting in the next acquiistion starting
        with inconsistent frame numbers between master and slave. Solved by 
        setting next frame number to the larger value (max + 1) after a stop command. 
        Requires a firmware update.

        Command line or python API: nextframenumber
        C++ API: get/setNextFrameNumber
        Can set/get the starting frame number for the next acquistion.


    *   [Mythen3] Readout speed
        Command line, python API: readoutspeed. Options: full_speed (10MHz), 
        half_speed (20MHz, default), quarter_speed (40MHz)
        C++ API: get/setReadoutSpeed
        Also affect: 
        Command line, python API: readoutspeedlist
        C++ API: getReadoutSpeedList


    *   Sleep
        Command line, python/ C++ API:  sleep
        Client sleeps for required time. Advanced command mainly for firmware
        developers to use in config files.


    *   Xilinx Chip Test Board added
