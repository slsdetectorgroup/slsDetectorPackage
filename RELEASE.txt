	--------------------------
	1. 	(Jungfrau) Bug fix: Same adc phase given to the PLL will still shift
		adc by one step. One can now give same adc phase repeatedly.
	
		Updated Command Line Manual for adcphase and clkdivider.
		
	2. 	(Eiger) Bug Fix: This bug was introduced in 3.1.0 release.
		In 10GbE mode, if "detectorip" is before "tengiga", the detector still
		used the 1G IP (DHCP IP). This is fixed in this release.
