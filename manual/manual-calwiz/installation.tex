The calibration wizards are based on the \textit{Root} software developed at CERN.\\
To install it, simply download it from the url \textit{http://root.cern.ch}.\\
You can either download the binaries for your system or install from source (which is time consuming, but possibly more stable).\\
The development and debugging of the wizards have been done using the root version 5.20, but it should be working also with newer versions.

After installing the root software, edit your .bashrc file to define the ROOTSYS enviroment variable, and add the binaries and libraries to your path, e.g.:
\begin{verbatim}
export ROOTSYS=/usr/local/root_sl5_32bit
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=$ROOTSYS/bin:$PATH
\end{verbatim} 

Then enter the calibrationWizards directory and compile:
\begin{verbatim}
make clean && make
\end{verbatim}

The two executables \textit{energyCalibrationWizard} and \textit{angularCalibrationWizard} should be generated, together with some documentation in pdf format inside the \textit{manual} directory.
